Adding support for a new archtecture to Fleece requires 3 steps:
    1. Adding a directory and CMakeLists.txt file for the architecture.
    2. Instantiating an Architecture object which contains:
         - the architecture name
         - the architecture's maximum instruction length
         - an initialization function that declares architecture register sets
         - an architecture-specific normalization function (can be NULL)
    3. Decoders that support this architecture (see doc/AddingDecoders.txt for more info)

For a minimal look at adding an architecture, check out arch/armv6/arch_armv6.C.
For a slightly more complex
architecture that contains many more register sets, see arch/aarch64/arch_aarch64.C. 
For a complex architecture
with many register sets and extensive normalization functions, see arch/x86_64/arch_x86_64.C.

Note: Adding an architecture will NOT require any changes to arch/Architecture.C or
arch/CMakeLists.txt. A good starting point for adding support for a new architecture would simply be
copying arch/armv6 and its contents to a new directory in arch/ and editting the copy.

Once you have instantiated an Architecture object (perhaps with the name "sparc"),
your architecture will be fully integrated into Fleece, including the runtime arguments.
You can run Fleece using this architecture as you would with any other by running
./fleece -arch=sparc <rest of fleece args>
