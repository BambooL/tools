Adding a decoder to Fleece:

To add a decoder to Fleece, you must provide two functions:

1. a decode function with the following signature and behavior:
    
    int decode(char* insn, int nBytes, char* buffer, int bufferLen);

    This function shall:
    1. Return 0 on success, non-zero value on failure
    2. Decode the first instruction from the buffer of bytes given by the insn argument,
       up to a maximum of nBytes bytes.
    3. Place at most bufferLen characters of the assembly language representation into
       the c-style string given by buffer. This must be null-terminated.

2. a normalize function with the following signature and behavior:

    void normalize(char* buffer, int bufLen);

    This function shall:
    1. Modify the null-terminated string contained in buffer such that the string
       can be assembled by the assembler used for testing.
    2. Place at most bufLen characters into the buffer.
    3. Maintain the null terminator of the c-string.
