Peach is a fuzzing tool used to compare assembly decoders.

To use peach, you must have a version of Intel's XED (which can be found here:
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/xed-x86-encoder-decoder-software-library) and Dyninst's Instruction API built to shared objects, LLVM 3.7.0 and
libopcodes. Configure the Makefile with paths to each of these locations.

Additionally, you will need to provide a load path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH) so that
the system can find those tools' libraries when running the executable.

Once the above configuration is complete, execute:

>make peach

to build peach.

Execute:

>./peach --help

for information about the options available with peach.
